5+ years in applied ML, including experience with retrieval, embeddings, and prompt engineering
Strong Python skills and familiarity with production-grade ML pipelines 
Experience designing and tuning RAG workflows with hybrid search 
Familiarity with RLHF and fine-tuning on structured JSON output 
Solid grasp of system-level thinking—how to bring ML into product environments cleanly 

Nice to have .NET understanding, especially for integration and orchestration layers

What success looks like in 6 months

Salary $140,000 - $180,000 per year

A Bit About Us

We’re transforming how government agencies digitize forms and automate workflows. Our new initiative brings AI directly into this process - using LLMs, vector search, and structured PDF parsing to accelerate public service delivery. We’re not just bolting AI onto the side. It’s becoming core to how our platform works.

We’re looking for a senior machine learning engineer to take the lead on this effort. You’ll be the architect of our AI capability - not just a contributor. Your work will touch thousands of public-facing government forms, helping real people get things done faster and more accurately. This isn’t an R&D team running experiments - it’s about delivering intelligent automation, right now.



Why join us?


100% remote based in the US
Help shape the AI transformation of public sector services
Lead initiatives that ship real impact, not just prototypes
Greenfield development on a proven, profitable platform
Comprehensive Health, Vision, Dental coverage for individuals and families

Job Details

You’ll design and build our machine learning infrastructure - starting with vector search and retrieval-augmented generation and expanding into fine-tuned LLMs with human feedback loops. You’ll work across product and engineering to embed intelligent behaviors into our no-code form builder. This is not a research job or a sandbox role - it’s a real opportunity to push AI into production at scale.

What you’ll do

Build and tune vector-based retrieval pipelines using OpenAI embeddings and Azure AI Search
Design prompt strategies and agents to translate parsed PDF data into form component schemas 
Fine-tune LLMs for structured output generation with low-latency performance in mind 
Lead the development of an RLHF loop that incorporates builder UI feedback and audit data 
Help architect systems that blend traditional APIs and probabilistic inference reliably 
Work alongside full-stack and platform engineers to get it all running in production 
Stay plugged into the latest model capabilities, and make smart calls on what to adopt

Tech you’ll use

Azure AI Studio, Azure OpenAI, GPT-4o 
Python (for agents, functions, orchestration), .NET 8 (for integration layers) 
Azure AI Search, CosmosDB, MSSQL 
Kubernetes (AKS), Azure Blob, Octopus for CI/CD 
Extend.ai for structured PDF parsing

What we’re looking for

5+ years in applied ML, including experience with retrieval, embeddings, and prompt engineering
Strong Python skills and familiarity with production-grade ML pipelines 
Experience designing and tuning RAG workflows with hybrid search 
Familiarity with RLHF and fine-tuning on structured JSON output 
Solid grasp of system-level thinking—how to bring ML into product environments cleanly 

Nice to have .NET understanding, especially for integration and orchestration layers

What success looks like in 6 months

You’ve shipped a working vector search + RAG pipeline integrated into our form builder 
You’ve scoped and kicked off our first LLM fine-tuning cycle 
We’re collecting human feedback to improve model accuracy 
You’ve helped define the roadmap for AI integrations across the platform
