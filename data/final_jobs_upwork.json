    "description": "Hello! We are a 19-year-old company based around a forum and Android app that receives over 100k visitors per day. We're looking for a full stack dev with an emphasis on php, sql, and the ability to make minor modifications in our existing Android app. If you have experience working with phpBB forum software, that's a huge plus. The job is part-time and mostly modifications rather than new features, as we're already well established. We prefer working with the same person in the very long-term; we've previously worked with the same dev for over 6 years.\n\nUkrainian devs may be preferred, though all are welcome (and encouraged) to apply.",
