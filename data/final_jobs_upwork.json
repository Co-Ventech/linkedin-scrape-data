    "title": "AI Voice Agent Retelling Project",
    "description": "Project Summary:\nI’m hiring for a complete build of an inbound AI voice receptionist system for a medical aesthetics clinic. The system must answer incoming calls, handle bookings, respond to treatment questions, capture and log lead details, and manage appointment gaps — all via automated responses. This project is for one clinic but should be structured so I can easily duplicate it for other clinics in the future.\n\nKey Objectives:\n\nInbound call answering with booking functionality\n\nSMS/email follow-ups after calls where no booking occurs\n\nAI responses to common treatment questions\n\nData logging of every call and lead into a spreadsheet system\n\nSystem to track cancellations and notify leads of openings via SMS or similar messaging\n\nUpsell opportunities offered by AI after confirmed bookings\n\nDelivery of a reusable template for use with other businesses\n\nDetailed Breakdown of What’s Required:\n\n1. AI Receptionist Handling Inbound Calls\nThe AI must pick up all calls during open hours and after hours. It should manage bookings, rescheduling, and cancellations using a connected calendar system and log each interaction into a structured spreadsheet with contact and treatment information.\n\n2. Answering Common FAQs\nThe AI should handle typical client questions about treatments, such as treatment differences, duration of effects, pricing ranges, and pre-treatment care. Example: answering what the difference is between two treatment types.\n\n3. Lead Capture for Enquiries Without Bookings\nFor callers who do not book, the AI must collect key details including name, contact information, and treatment interest, and store these in the spreadsheet for future follow-up.\n\n4. Automated Follow-Up Messaging\nThere should be automated follow-ups for non-booked leads, sent via text or email within a defined period (such as 24 to 48 hours), logged in the spreadsheet system.\n\n5. Handling Cancellations and Refilling Gaps\nThe system must track appointment cancellations and offer the available slots to recent enquiries or waitlist contacts via messaging — no outbound calling required.\n\n6. Upselling Treatments After Booking\nFollowing a successful booking, AI should suggest additional services that pair well with their treatment, optionally confirming these add-ons during the call or follow-up messaging.\n\n7. Pre-Treatment Guidance\nAfter a booking, the system should automatically send treatment preparation instructions to the client.\n\n8. After-Hours Call Handling\nOutside business hours, the AI must still answer calls, capture caller information, and offer a callback option for the next day.\n\nExpected Deliverables:\n\nFully functional AI receptionist system working end-to-end\n\nConnected automation scenarios managing call responses and data logging\n\nCalendar booking system integration\n\nSMS and/or email integration for follow-ups\n\nCancellations triggering gap-fill messages\n\nSimple template for re-use across other businesses\n\nClear, user-friendly setup guide for template replication\n\nHow You’ll Be Evaluated:\nI will test all main flows after setup: answering, booking, FAQ responses, data logging, follow-ups, and cancellation responses. The project will be considered successful when the system handles these tasks accurately without manual intervention.\n\nTo Apply:\nPlease provide your estimated time for completion, a fixed project quote, and a brief summary of how you would approach this build. If you deliver this project successfully, I will have additional projects of the same nature on an ongoing basis.",

They want a strategic, high-performing, fast, and conversion-focused website that looks and functions beautifully across all devices.\n\nI have a very keen eye for design and UX. I don’t allow anything to go live unless it meets a very high standard.\n\nI’ve been burned in the past by developers who overpromised and underdelivered. So I’m extremely thorough when it comes to vetting.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\nClient: A B2B manufacturing company (if you’ve worked with similar clients, big plus!)\n\nTimeline: 75–90 days (about 8–11 weeks)\n\nStart: ASAP (next week!)\n\nPhases:\nDiscovery, planning & content strategy (1 week)\nSitemap & UX wireframe (1–2 weeks)\nUI design for desktop & mobile (1–2 weeks)\nWebsite development (4–5 weeks)\nQA, launch & SEO finalization (1 week)\n\nPlease only apply if you are confident you can deliver this website within the provided time frame. \n\nWho I’m looking for:\n\nSomeone who is either a strong designer and developer, or an exceptional developer with a solid sense of design (I can help guide design decisions if needed).\n\nSomeone who works collaboratively and is open to feedback — you’ll work directly with me (I’ll be overseeing strategy and design) and my copywriter.\n\nSomeone who will be open to using Asana for project tracking and Slack for communication.\n\nSomeone highly responsive... I can’t stress this enough. If I ask a question or share feedback, I need to know you’ll be on it quickly.\n\nSomeone who works efficiently and can adapt fast.\n\nSomeone who is absolutely fine with having a video call (with camera on) as part of the interview process — non-negotiable.\n\n\nImportant note:\n\nIf you plan to copy my posting and paste it into ChatGPT, and then copy-paste your proposal back to me, please don’t. I will not even look at your website links if I see that. I can tell when a proposal is AI-generated and I won’t consider it.\n\nWhat I need from you in your proposal:\n Links to live websites you’ve worked on.\nFor each website link:\n\nWhat aspects were you involved in? (Design, development, copywriting?)\n\nWhat challenges did you face on this project, and how did you overcome them?\n\nWhat was the total timeframe to complete it?\n\nAnything else you want to share about your process or why you think we’d be a great match.\n\n\nIf you’re someone who takes pride in your work, loves collaborating, communicates like a human, and wants to be part of something that actually cares about quality, I’d love to hear from you.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your work and hearing your story.",

    "description": "Project Overview\nWe are seeking an experienced web developer with expertise in web security and automation to build a tool in Replit that scans company domains for URLs containing web forms and performs vulnerability assessments on those forms. The tool should allow users to upload a list of domains, crawl them to identify form-containing URLs, and feed those URLs into a vulnerability scanner to detect issues like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. The project leverages open-source libraries and APIs, with a focus on simplicity, automation, and compliance with ethical/legal guidelines (e.g., scanning only with permission).\nScope of Work\nThe tool will be developed in Replit (a browser-based IDE) using Python and relevant libraries, with a simple interface for domain input and report output. It will consist of two main components: form discovery and vulnerability scanning, integrated into a single workflow.\nKey Features\n\nDomain Input:\n\nAccept a list of domains (e.g., via CSV file upload or text input in Replit's interface).\nValidate domains for correctness (e.g., proper format like \"example.com\").\nOptional: Include subdomain discovery (e.g., via an API like dnsdumpster.com or a library like dns.resolver).\n\n\nForm Discovery (Crawling):\n\nCrawl each domain to find URLs containing form tags.\nUse a Python-based crawler (e.g., Scrapy or BeautifulSoup with requests) to parse HTML and identify forms.\nHandle JavaScript-rendered pages (e.g., using Selenium or Replit's headless browser support).\nRespect robots.txt and implement rate-limiting to avoid overloading servers.\nOutput a list of unique form URLs.\n\n\nVulnerability Scanning:\n\nFeed discovered form URLs into a vulnerability scanner.\nIntegrate with an open-source scanner (e.g., OWASP ZAP API) or a commercial scanner API (e.g., Pentest-Tools Website Vulnerability Scanner) for automated testing.\nTarget common web form vulnerabilities, including:\nInjection attacks (SQLi, Command Injection)\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nInsecure Direct Object References (IDOR)\nInsecure file uploads\nSensitive data exposure\n\n\nHandle authenticated forms (optional, via user-provided credentials).\n\n\nReporting:\n\nGenerate a report summarizing:\nList of domains scanned\nForm URLs found\nVulnerabilities detected (with severity ratings, e.g., CVSS scores)\nRemediation recommendations (e.g., \"Use CSRF tokens\")\n\n\nOutput in a user-friendly format (e.g., HTML, JSON, or Markdown) within Replit.\n\n\nReplit-Specific Requirements:\n\nBuild entirely in Replit, using Python (pre-installed libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, or installable ones like scrapy).\nEnsure compatibility with Replit’s environment (e.g., no local file I/O for pygame, but web I/O is fine).\nUse Replit’s web hosting for the interface (e.g., Flask for a simple frontend).\nMaintain stateful execution within Replit’s REPL for iterative testing.\n\n\n\nDeliverables\n\nA fully functional tool hosted in a Replit project (shared via Replit’s public link).\nSource code with clear comments and documentation.\nA user guide (Markdown file) explaining how to:\nInput domains\nRun the crawler and scanner\nView and interpret reports\n\n\nTest cases demonstrating the tool on sample domains (e.g., public test sites like OWASP WebGoat, with permission).\nOptional: Integration with a free-tier API (e.g., Pentest-Tools or OWASP ZAP) for scanning.\n\nTechnical Requirements\n\nPrimary Language: Python 3.x\nLibraries/Frameworks (available or installable in Replit):\nscrapy or beautifulsoup4 + requests for crawling\nselenium (if JavaScript rendering is needed)\nflask for a web interface\nAPIs for scanning (e.g., OWASP ZAP or Pentest-Tools)\n\n\nEnvironment: Replit (browser-based, no local setup required)\nConstraints:\nNo external file I/O beyond Replit’s capabilities.\nRespect rate limits and ethical scanning practices (e.g., prompt user to confirm permission).\nHandle large domains efficiently (e.g., cap crawl depth, parallelize requests).\n\n\n\nSkills Required\n\nMust-Have:\nProficiency in Python (web scraping, API integration)\nExperience with web crawling (Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or similar)\nKnowledge of web security and common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)\nFamiliarity with Replit or similar cloud IDEs\n\n\nNice-to-Have:\nExperience with OWASP ZAP or commercial scanner APIs\nWeb development with Flask for UI\nUnderstanding of JavaScript rendering for dynamic sites\nFamiliarity with DevSecOps and DAST/SAST principles\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\nDuration: 2-3 weeks\nMilestones:\nWeek 1: Set up Replit project, build domain input and crawling module, test on sample domains.\nWeek 2: Integrate vulnerability scanner, implement reporting, and build basic UI.\nWeek 3 (if needed): Testing, bug fixes, documentation, and delivery.",

The current UI was built quickly and served its purpose, but we’re ready to clean it up and level it up using modern best practices.\n\nThis isn’t a pixel-perfect Figma-to-code job. We’re intentionally moving away from overly custom design work and toward component libraries (like ShadCN, Tailwind UI, etc.) that allow us to move fast while maintaining a high standard of quality and visual clarity.\n\nOur product is a real-time dashboard and management interface for customers — mostly tables, lists, modals, and workflows. Nothing overly complex.

We “vibe-code” with Claude Code today, but we need a real engineer who loves building (not just integrating) large-language-model tech and can push our tooling, automations, and client deliverables to the next level.\n\nWe’re not looking for someone who just wires up APIs or wraps OpenAI calls in a Flask app. We want a **deeply AI-enabled coder**—someone who codes *with* models as a co-pilot, experiments with agentic workflows, uses AI to refactor and reason, and constantly pushes the frontier on what’s possible with model-assisted development. You should be opinionated about your stack, excited by new tooling, and able to tell us what you’re using today, what’s missing, and what you wish you had.\n\nThis role will be hired and paid through Upwork. \nStart as an hourly contract; grow into our go-to engineering partner if we both love the fit.\n\nWhat You’ll Own\n- Architect and ship production-grade LLM pipelines (chat, RAG, multi-agent, fine-tuning)\n- Wrangle data and infra: chunking, embeddings, vector DBs, GPU and CPU scaling, CI and CD, monitoring\n- Prototype new workflows fast—then harden them for client deployments\n- Stay bleeding-edge: scout 2025’s newest models, frameworks, and ops tools and bring the best ideas back\n- Level us up: teach two technical founders better engineering discipline and automate yourself out of repetitive tasks\n\nMust-Haves\n- Proven LLM experience: you’ve built and shipped at least one serious LLM or RAG system in production—be ready to walk us through the architecture\n- Fluent coder: Python first; TypeScript, Go, or Rust a plus. Clean code, tests, and Git workflow are table stakes\n- Infra literacy: Docker, Kubernetes or serverless runtimes; vector stores (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector); vLLM or TensorRT-LLM or equivalent for fast inference\n- System thinker: you balance latency, cost, and accuracy, and have strong opinions on prompt vs retrieval vs fine-tune trade-offs\n- AI-native developer mindset: you treat models as tools in your coding toolbox, not just services you call\n\nNice-to-Haves\n- Modal, Ray, or RunPod experience for elastic GPU workloads\n- Front-end comfort (React or Nextjs) to wire up quick demos\n- Data ops and fine-tune tooling: Kubeflow, BentoML, LoRA, PEFT\n- Prior consulting or startup experience where you juggled ambiguity and many hats\n\nHow We Work\n- 100 percent remote, async-first, lightweight meetings\n- Ship iterative, testable slices—no months-long stealth builds\n\nHow to Apply\nIn your proposal, include exactly three sections — nothing more, nothing less:\n\n1. 200 words or less on why you’re obsessed with AI-first engineering. Be specific about how you use AI to code, what tools you rely on daily, and what AI capabilities you wish existed.\n2. A link to one LLM or RAG project you built (repo or deep technical write-up)\n3. One paragraph on the most exciting 2025 tool or technique you’d use to 10x our workflow efficiency — and how\n\nIf your experience is real and your ideas are fresh, we’ll move fast.
