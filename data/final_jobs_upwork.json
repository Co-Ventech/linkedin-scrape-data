If the network don't want the lead, we will ping another network, to see if they want it using their API, and if they also dont want it we send them to another page that doesn't require any autofill.\n\nIt need to also work with:\n\nPixel and tracking readiness (Meta, Google Tag)\n\nThe funnel needs to:\n\nUse custom design (not template-based – pixel-perfect front end is key. I already have pictures of how I want it to be tho. It's a very very simple form. Should not take long to create)\n\nValidate fields like email, phone, loan amount (min / max )\n\nCall My two affiliate networks API on form submit (POST request, as documented here: [API docs will be shared])\n\nStore session data (JWT and ApplicationID)\n\nRedirect to next quiz step (e.g. step2.html) after API success\n\nBe mobile responsive\n\nWork inside GoHighLevel using custom code blocks or via external hosting\n\nInclude checkboxes for marketing consent\n\nTech Stack:\n\nHTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript\n\nMust work within GoHighLevel or externally hosted and embedded\n\nBonus if you have experience with affiliate tracking / attribution logic\n\nTo apply, please:\n\nShare examples of similar work\n\nTell me how you'd approach this project technically (at a high level)\n\nInclude the word “LAAN” at the top of your application so I know you read this\n\nLooking forward to working with a detail-oriented dev who understands both design and performance.",

We want to use OCR to read those images for their digital code. We want to add those to an excel sheet and tie that to the Google Drive image. Then we want to use ai to go to the Movies Anywhere redeem page and check those codes to see if they work. We do not want to redeem the codes just check if they are working. Once the code and title for the movie has been confirmed we will find the TT code for the movie from the IMDB website. Then we will list it to a WooCommerce backend for sale.\n\nThis is how GPT says to tackle the project, but I would default to your judgement. \n\nTrigger: Image Upload to Google Drive\n\nOCR: Extract Code from Image\n\nLog: Append Code and Image Link to Excel/Sheet\n\nVerify Code via Movies Anywhere\n\nScrape Title & Find IMDb TT Code\n\nPost to WooCommerce via API\n\nStep 1: Trigger on New Google Drive Upload\nn8n Node: Google Drive Trigger\n\nAction: Fires when new image file is uploaded to a specific folder\n\nStep 2: OCR to Extract Code from Image\nModel Options:\n\nGoogle Cloud Vision API (Best Quality)\n\nTesseract.js (Open-source, but lower accuracy)\n\nn8n Node: HTTP Request or Custom Function Node (for Vision API)\n\nWhat to extract: Alphanumeric string (typical digital code format)\n\nStep 3: Log Code & Image Reference to Spreadsheet\nDestination: Google Sheet or Excel (OneDrive)\n\nn8n Nodes:\n\nGoogle Sheets → “Append Row” with:\n\nFilename\n\nDetected Code\n\nDrive Link\n\n(Empty columns for title, TT code, verified? etc.)\n\nStep 4: Verify Code on Movies Anywhere\n⚠️ Important: You must mimic a browser session without submitting the redemption.\n\nApproach:\n\nUse Puppeteer or Playwright outside n8n to simulate the browser\n\nOr try a headless browser via n8n's [Execute Command] node with a script\n\nGoal: Input code, observe UI response (\"Invalid\" vs. \"Valid for Movie X\")\n\nModel: Use a lightweight image classifier (optional) or regex to extract the title from result\n\nStep 5: Find IMDb TT Code for the Movie\nOption 1: Use IMDb Search API\n\n3rd party APIs like OMDb API\n\nInput movie title → Get IMDb ID (tt#######)\n\nOption 2: Scrape IMDb directly (e.g., with serpapi or headless browser)\n\nStep 6: Post to WooCommerce\nn8n Node: WooCommerce\n\nMethod: POST\n\nData:\n\nTitle\n\nCode (as custom field or private note)\n\nIMDb ID\n\nPrice\n\nCategory\n\nStock quantity: 1\n\nImage (optional, via GDrive link)",

When I create an account on the site (seller or buyer account) Dokan doesn't let me choose the password for my account, and when I enter forgotten password, no password is sent to me.\n\nIn short, I can do wordpress, but Dokan can't (lack of time).\n\nIf I provide you with all the necessary resources, do you think you'll be able to integrate Dokan into the site in the right way? The project is simple: to create a giant local marketplace for the island of Malta. Sellers simply need to create an account, publish their products and then be able to sell their products throughout Malta. Buyers need to be able to find their way around the site easily, and buy without difficulty.\n\nCan you help me with this?

We will need android done as well but let's do ios first. \n\nOk so the current agency has implemented location tracking to work the way it does but we believe more can be done to make it work the way we want. This is where you have to prove you know what you are talking about. Location tracking needs to work consistently and not be killed by OS or suspended. \n\nNow it is essential that you have worked on logistics/delivery apps before or still manage the projects and we will want some kind of proof on this. Links to the app store simply will not cut it, we need solid proof. We appreciate your clients privacy and signed NDA's but we are not asking for you to share the codebase, you will have to find a solution.\n\nI've attached the appdelegate, swiftbackgroundplugin and info.plist files for you to see the current setup. So when you message to offer your services, i would like to know estimates in that message. \n\nI'm also not looking to share the full code, i don't believe you need the whole code to be able to provide a solution.\n\nYou might also want to think of the best way to implement the changes seeing as we already have an agency managing our project.",
