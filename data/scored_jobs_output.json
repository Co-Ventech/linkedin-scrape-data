We ingest analytics events from customers (e.g. button clicks, purchases) and make them available for querying with SQL. We need to scale to millions of events per second while keeping latency low (Warehouse Native Product Analytics. We are building an analytics suite (a la Mixpanel or Amplitude) on top of a company’s existing SQL data warehouse. This will require extensive front-end work, data engineering, and performance tuning.Realtime Feature Flag Analytics. When a developer pushes code live, they want to know two things right away - “Did I just break anything?” and “Is anyone using my new feature?”. APM tools like DataDog only get you part of the way there and we want to build a truly comprehensive solution.Robust SQL Test Suite. We support 12 different SQL data sources, from Postgres to BigQuery to PrestoDB, and each of them have their own quirks and bugs that we need to work around. Supporting this at scale will require building robust automated test suites and provisioning complex cloud infrastructure on demand.Streaming Features Service. When someone toggles a feature flag in GrowthBook, we want it to propagate to all of their clients around the world within seconds. And we need to do this reliably (99.999% uptime) and at scale (billions of requests per day).\n\nRequirements\n\nExpert in Typescript, React, and Node.jsSolid understanding of both SQL and NoSQL databasesExperience building large web applications from scratchFluent English and good communication skillsStartup experience or interest working in a small companyBonus: Contributed to an open-source projectBonus: Used feature flags or A\/B testing at a previous companyBonus: Built data-heavy analytics applications\n\nBenefits\n\n100% remote work from anywhere (within US time zones)Health, Vision, and Dental benefits (we cover 100% of the cost for employees and 95% for dependents)Generous tech stipend for your home office (or coworking space)Regular off-sites in exciting places (our latest one was in the Dominican Republic)\n\nGrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.\n\nWe regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time, although we can make exceptions for H1B transfers.",

But whether we’re looking to save for a rainy day, grow our money, buy a home, or even build a retirement fund, we leave it at the bottom of our to-do lists because we're not sure how to get started.\n\nThis isn’t surprising. We aren’t taught about financial planning at school, the wealth industry was built to serve a minority, and it often feels like banks don’t care about helping us achieve outcomes. To top it off, the financial services industry is fragmented and confusing.\n\nThis means that our money often isn’t working hard enough and our goals are much harder to achieve.\n\nSo, we made a solution.\n\nWe've brought saving, investing, home-buying, and retirement services together into one simple app. So people can reach their goals and build wealth with confidence, whatever their starting point.\n\nWe want to help people build wealth, but our mission goes beyond that. We believe that building wealth isn’t simply about accumulating more money. It’s about going after the life you want and enjoying it to the fullest, today and tomorrow.
