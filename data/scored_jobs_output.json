    "descriptionText": "You're the kind of DevOps engineer who doesn't just keep the lights on; you make sure they never go out in the first place. If your idea of fun is tearing into a tangled mess of legacy infrastructure, designing a more efficient system, and automating away every repetitive task you encounter, then you're in the right place. We're looking for a DevOps and AWS infrastructure expert who thrives in high-stakes environments, where 99.9% uptime is expected. You'll work across a portfolio of acquired products, each with its own quirks, migrating them into a streamlined, scalable AWS ecosystem while building monitoring and automation that actually makes incidents rare.\n\nMost companies want you to maintain a single stack. We want you to consolidate and optimize multiple stacks without breaking anything along the way. While others isolate databases, we do the opposite, strategically consolidating them to optimize for cost and management efficiency across our portfolio. This isn't a role for someone who wants to babysit existing infrastructure; it's for someone who sees an inconsistent, fragmented environment and immediately starts designing a better one.\n\nYou'll own everything from infrastructure migrations to AI-driven automation, performance tuning, database migration, and cost optimization. That means diagnosing and fixing what's broken, planning and executing seamless cloud migrations with near-zero downtime, and automating away half of your own job with AI/ML-powered workflows. You'll have real authority to make infrastructure decisions—no waiting around for approvals from people who don't understand what's actually happening under the hood.\n\nIf you're an independent problem-solver who thrives on untangling complex systems and making them run flawlessly, this job will be your playground. If you need extensive hand-holding, get overwhelmed by multiple tech stacks, or prefer clean-slate projects over making order from chaos, you're going to hate it here. If you're ready to take ownership of a high-impact infrastructure role with room to build, optimize, and automate at scale, apply now!\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\nPlanning and executing complex infrastructure changes, including migrations from legacy systems to AWS cloud infrastructure and lift-and-shift migrationsDesigning and implementing monitoring plans and building automations for monitoring, software deployments, and operational workflowsPerforming system monitoring, system backups, incident response, database migrations, database configurations, and cost optimization\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n\nLiving in Jira and endless status meetings - we value people who can drive solutions, not just track problemsMaintaining outdated systems indefinitely - you'll be empowered to drive meaningful improvementsGetting blocked by bureaucratic approval chains - you'll have the authority to execute immediate fixes to resolve incidentsGetting stuck in narrow technical silos - this role requires both breadth and depth of expertiseFighting for budget to implement critical improvements - we understand the importance of infrastructure investment\n\nSenior DevOps Engineer Key Responsibilities\n\nDrive reliability and standardization of cloud infrastructure across our growing product portfolio by implementing robust monitoring, automation, and AWS best practices.\n\nBasic Requirements\n\nDeep AWS infrastructure expertise (this is our primary platform - other cloud experience alone won't cut it)Strong programming skills in Python or JavaScript for building automation and toolingExperience managing and migrating production databases with multiple engines (including MySql, Postgres, Oracle, MS-SQL)Advanced Docker/Kubernetes skillsExperience with infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation)Linux systems administration expertise\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.\n\nThere is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!\n\nWorking with us\n\nThis is a full-time (40 hours per week), long-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record.

    "descriptionText": "If you’re the kind of engineer who gets bored writing the same flaky test cases and maintaining brittle scripts, this role will feel like a jailbreak. We're looking for someone who can wield AI like a weapon in QA. You’ll own the creation of intelligent, adaptive test automation frameworks that evolve with the product. You’ll use GenAI to do what QA was never allowed to before: simulate edge-case user behaviors, generate stress conditions on the fly, and surface the bugs nobody else knew to look for.\n\nMost orgs are stuck chasing regressions and waiting for builds to break. We’re building something different. Our team is embedded directly in the product loop, not tacked on at the end. We’re automating QA workflows by having GenAI generate test plans, scripts, and even test data from live product requirements. You won’t be waiting around for tickets; you’ll be building the AI layer that anticipates issues before users ever see them.\n\nThis isn’t a job for someone looking to stick to tried-and-true tools and manual testing rituals. This is QA redefined — built on automated quality analytics, AI-simulated failure scenarios, and real-time test coverage feedback that actually shapes release decisions. You won’t be validating someone else’s work; you’ll be shipping the system that keeps quality from slipping through the cracks. It’s fast, it’s messy, and it’s deeply technical.\n\nYou’ll join a high-velocity, AI-first product team that is focused on building the core of our AI-powered user experience. If you’ve got the chops to engineer scalable automation frameworks, can think like a detective with code, and aren’t afraid to bend AI to your will, apply now!\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\nImplement and maintain AI-based test automation frameworks to increase test coverage and efficiencyUse GenAI tools to analyze testing outcomes, identify patterns in defects, and provide actionable insights for continuous improvementEmploy GenAI to simulate user scenarios, stress conditions, and edge cases to uncover potential issues before they impact users\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n\nSpending your days writing repetitive, manual test casesBeing a bottleneck by waiting on traditional ticket systemsWorking in isolation from the product development teamRelying solely on traditional QA tools and methods\n\nSoftware Quality Assurance Engineer Key Responsibilities\n\nEnable bug-free, high-performance releases through QA automation using AI tools and quality audits, maintaining the quality of releases\n\nBasic Requirements\n\nAt least 4 years of experience in QA engineering, with hands-on experience in test automation frameworksExperience using or building with GenAI tools for development or QA\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack.

To help them fulfill their potential.\n\nAcross 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.\n\nAnd we never give up.\n\nFor every child, HOPE!\n\nVacancy Announcement: Consultant\n\nConsultancy Title: HIV Data Scientist Consultant\n\nSection/Division/Duty Station: Division of Data, Analytics, Planning and Monitoring (DAPM, Data & Analytics, Health and HIV Unit) New York HQ\n\nDuration: July 2025 to July 2026\n\nHome/ Office Based: REMOTE\n\nAbout UNICEF\n\nIf you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPurpose Of Activity/Assignment\n\nThe Division of Data, Analytics, Planning and Monitoring (DAPM) was created in 2019 to strengthen decision making and organisational learning across UNICEF. It sets the corporate direction for evidence informed analysis, strategic planning, programme monitoring and performance management, ensuring that every programme result rests on rigorous data and rights based practice. Within the Division, the Data and Analytics Team (DAT) serves as the organisation’s primary source of global statistics on children, curating administrative records, household surveys, geospatial information and other large data sets, maintaining their quality and public availability through data.unicef.org, and driving investments that help national statistical systems measure what matters for children.\n\nThe Health and HIV Unit (HHU) within DAPM focuses on leveraging data and analytics to strengthen health systems, improve programmatic decisions, and enhance outcomes in immunization, HIV, and maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health.

This role is fully remote, but we do prefer candidates in US timezones so everyone has some overlapping work hours. As an early employee, you will have immense impact on the product and business.\n\nSome of the problems you’ll be working on\n\nScaling Event Ingestion. We ingest analytics events from customers (e.g. button clicks, purchases) and make them available for querying with SQL. We need to scale to millions of events per second while keeping latency low (Warehouse Native Product Analytics. We are building an analytics suite (a la Mixpanel or Amplitude) on top of a company’s existing SQL data warehouse. This will require extensive front-end work, data engineering, and performance tuning.Realtime Feature Flag Analytics. When a developer pushes code live, they want to know two things right away - “Did I just break anything?” and “Is anyone using my new feature?”. APM tools like DataDog only get you part of the way there and we want to build a truly comprehensive solution.Robust SQL Test Suite. We support 12 different SQL data sources, from Postgres to BigQuery to PrestoDB, and each of them have their own quirks and bugs that we need to work around. Supporting this at scale will require building robust automated test suites and provisioning complex cloud infrastructure on demand.Streaming Features Service. When someone toggles a feature flag in GrowthBook, we want it to propagate to all of their clients around the world within seconds. And we need to do this reliably (99.999% uptime) and at scale (billions of requests per day).\n\nRequirements\n\nExpert in Typescript, React, and Node.jsSolid understanding of both SQL and NoSQL databasesExperience building large web applications from scratchFluent English and good communication skillsStartup experience or interest working in a small companyBonus: Contributed to an open-source projectBonus: Used feature flags or A/B testing at a previous companyBonus: Built data-heavy analytics applications\n\nBenefits\n\n100% remote work from anywhere (within US time zones)Health, Vision, and Dental benefits (we cover 100% of the cost for employees and 95% for dependents)Generous tech stipend for your home office (or coworking space)Regular off-sites in exciting places (our latest one was in the Dominican Republic)\n\nGrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.\n\nWe regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time, although we can make exceptions for H1B transfers.",

Since 2014, Consensys has been at the forefront of innovation, pioneering technological developments within the web3 ecosystem.\n\nThrough our product suite, including the MetaMask platform, Infura, Linea, Diligence, and our NFT toolkit Phosphor, we have become the trusted collaborator for users, creators, and developers on their path to build and belong in the world they want to see.\n\nWhether building a dapp, an NFT collection, a portfolio, or a better future, the instinct to build is universal. Consensys inspires and champions the builder instinct in everyone by making web3 universally easy to use and develop on.\n\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making the decentralized web universally easy to access, use, and build on.\n\nYou’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to onboard one billion participants and 5 million developers.

Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nSELECT BELOW\n\n$85,000—$160,000 USD\n\nIn the rapidly evolving Web3 space, we believe that everyone is a builder.
