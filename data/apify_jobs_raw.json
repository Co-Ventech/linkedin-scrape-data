That DNA remains at our core, but today we are evolving into a fully remote, globally distributed Investment Management business. This transformation reflects a broader ambition: to scale our edge, deliver institutional-grade results, and set new standards for the industry.\nOur quantitative environment is built to empower innovation, combining vast data capabilities, disciplined model development, and highly automated execution. Risk is embedded in every layer of our thinking, with robust measurement, control, and scenario analysis integrated into our systems and decision-making. Technology is not just a tool for us, it’s a core competency and a competitive advantage.\nRole Overview\nNetwork Security Engineer – TechOpsWe’re looking for a Network Security Engineer to help strengthen and secure our cloud-native infrastructure at the core of AlgoQuant’s research and trading systems.

Our platform helps MSPs achieve big automation wins, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. We value the flexibility of remote work and enjoy opportunities to collaborate in person on occasion.\n\nJob Overview:\n\nWe’re looking for a proactive and experienced Senior QA Engineer to take ownership of quality assurance on a dedicated project squad. In this role, you’ll be the primary QA resource, responsible for driving test strategy, executing test plans, and collaborating closely with developers and product managers to ensure a high-quality product. While your main focus will be leading QA efforts for your assigned team, you’ll also be expected to flexibly support other teams as needed based on shifting priorities and business goals.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n\nServe as the primary QA point of contact for a dedicated cross-functional project squad. Test new integrations with third-party vendors and ensure seamless functionality. Conduct functional, regression, and exploratory testing for new features and bug fixes across different platforms. Identify, document, and track bugs and issues found during testing in Shortcut or other tracking tools. Work closely with development teams to ensure timely bug resolution. Collaborate with the product team during the planning process to ensure upcoming changes are testable and meet quality standards. Assist in developing and maintaining test plans and test cases for different projects. Contribute to the development of automated tests as part of a growing automation initiative. Provide feedback on testing strategies, tools, and best practices to improve overall QA processes. Contribute to the team's ongoing automation efforts by identifying high-value test cases for automation, maintaining existing scripts, and collaborating with our Automation Architect to expand automated coverage. Lead QA-side root cause analysis (RCA) for bugs that reach production by reproducing issues, identifying testing gaps, and implementing process or test improvements to prevent recurrence. Test from the perspective of the end user to identify usability issues and provide thoughtful feedback to the product team aimed at improving the overall customer experience. Step into multiple QA roles as needed, whether that means jumping in on another team, helping triage production issues, or supporting cross-functional testing efforts. Operate with a high level of autonomy—able to navigate ambiguity, make informed decisions, and keep momentum without needing constant direction. \n\nRequired Skills and Qualifications:\n\n5-7+ years of experience as a QA Engineer in an Agile environment. Experience with manual and automation testing of web applications, SaaS platforms, and third-party integrations. Strong understanding of software testing methodologies, tools, and processes. Experience with writing test plans, test cases, and executing structured testing efforts. Familiarity with bug tracking and test management tools (e.g., Shortcut, Jira, TestRail). Knowledge of APIs, content formats (JSON, XML), and API testing tools (e.g., Postman). Ability to adapt quickly to different teams and projects, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills. Proven ability to take initiative and identify opportunities for improvement or contribution without needing direction. Strong communication skills with a willingness to voice ideas, concerns, and constructive feedback to influence product quality and team processes. Comfortable working in a fast-paced startup environment with the adaptability, energy, and engagement to keep up with shifting priorities. \n\nAbove & Beyond:\n\nExperience with automated testing frameworks such as Playwright, Selenium, or similar. Experience with API testing and automation. Previous experience in a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) company or low-code/no-code platform. Experience integrating automated tests with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI. \n\nWhy Join Us: \n\nOpportunity to make a significant impact in a fast-growing startup environmentCollaborative and inclusive culture that values creativity, diversity, and innovation Competitive compensation package, including equity options and benefitsFlexible work arrangements and a supportive work-life balance\n\nCompensation Range: $125K - $135K\n\n",
