    "descriptionText": "You're the kind of DevOps engineer who doesn't just keep the lights on; you make sure they never go out in the first place. If your idea of fun is tearing into a tangled mess of legacy infrastructure, designing a more efficient system, and automating away every repetitive task you encounter, then you're in the right place. We're looking for a DevOps and AWS infrastructure expert who thrives in high-stakes environments, where 99.9% uptime is expected. You'll work across a portfolio of acquired products, each with its own quirks, migrating them into a streamlined, scalable AWS ecosystem while building monitoring and automation that actually makes incidents rare.\n\nMost companies want you to maintain a single stack. We want you to consolidate and optimize multiple stacks without breaking anything along the way. While others isolate databases, we do the opposite, strategically consolidating them to optimize for cost and management efficiency across our portfolio. This isn't a role for someone who wants to babysit existing infrastructure; it's for someone who sees an inconsistent, fragmented environment and immediately starts designing a better one.\n\nYou'll own everything from infrastructure migrations to AI-driven automation, performance tuning, database migration, and cost optimization. That means diagnosing and fixing what's broken, planning and executing seamless cloud migrations with near-zero downtime, and automating away half of your own job with AI/ML-powered workflows. You'll have real authority to make infrastructure decisions—no waiting around for approvals from people who don't understand what's actually happening under the hood.\n\nIf you're an independent problem-solver who thrives on untangling complex systems and making them run flawlessly, this job will be your playground. If you need extensive hand-holding, get overwhelmed by multiple tech stacks, or prefer clean-slate projects over making order from chaos, you're going to hate it here. If you're ready to take ownership of a high-impact infrastructure role with room to build, optimize, and automate at scale, apply now!\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\nPlanning and executing complex infrastructure changes, including migrations from legacy systems to AWS cloud infrastructure and lift-and-shift migrationsDesigning and implementing monitoring plans and building automations for monitoring, software deployments, and operational workflowsPerforming system monitoring, system backups, incident response, database migrations, database configurations, and cost optimization\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n\nLiving in Jira and endless status meetings - we value people who can drive solutions, not just track problemsMaintaining outdated systems indefinitely - you'll be empowered to drive meaningful improvementsGetting blocked by bureaucratic approval chains - you'll have the authority to execute immediate fixes to resolve incidentsGetting stuck in narrow technical silos - this role requires both breadth and depth of expertiseFighting for budget to implement critical improvements - we understand the importance of infrastructure investment\n\nSenior DevOps Engineer Key Responsibilities\n\nDrive reliability and standardization of cloud infrastructure across our growing product portfolio by implementing robust monitoring, automation, and AWS best practices.\n\nBasic Requirements\n\nDeep AWS infrastructure expertise (this is our primary platform - other cloud experience alone won't cut it)Strong programming skills in Python or JavaScript for building automation and toolingExperience managing and migrating production databases with multiple engines (including MySql, Postgres, Oracle, MS-SQL)Advanced Docker/Kubernetes skillsExperience with infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation)Linux systems administration expertise\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack.

    "descriptionHtml": "You&#39;re the kind of DevOps engineer who doesn&#39;t just keep the lights on; you make sure they never go out in the first place. If your idea of fun is tearing into a tangled mess of legacy infrastructure, designing a more efficient system, and automating away every repetitive task you encounter, then you&#39;re in the right place. We&#39;re looking for a DevOps and AWS infrastructure expert who thrives in high-stakes environments, where 99.9% uptime is expected. You&#39;ll work across a portfolio of acquired products, each with its own quirks, migrating them into a streamlined, scalable AWS ecosystem while building monitoring and automation that actually makes incidents rare.<br><br><br><br>Most companies want you to maintain a single stack. We want you to consolidate and optimize multiple stacks without breaking anything along the way. While others isolate databases, we do the opposite, strategically consolidating them to optimize for cost and management efficiency across our portfolio. This isn&#39;t a role for someone who wants to babysit existing infrastructure; it&#39;s for someone who sees an inconsistent, fragmented environment and immediately starts designing a better one.<br><br><br><br>You&#39;ll own everything from infrastructure migrations to AI-driven automation, performance tuning, database migration, and cost optimization. That means diagnosing and fixing what&#39;s broken, planning and executing seamless cloud migrations with near-zero downtime, and automating away half of your own job with AI/ML-powered workflows. You&#39;ll have real authority to make infrastructure decisions—no waiting around for approvals from people who don&#39;t understand what&#39;s actually happening under the hood.<br><br><br><br>If you&#39;re an independent problem-solver who thrives on untangling complex systems and making them run flawlessly, this job will be your playground. If you need extensive hand-holding, get overwhelmed by multiple tech stacks, or prefer clean-slate projects over making order from chaos, you&#39;re going to hate it here. If you&#39;re ready to take ownership of a high-impact infrastructure role with room to build, optimize, and automate at scale, apply now!<br><br><br><br><b>What You Will Be Doing<br><br><br><br></b><ul><li>Planning and executing complex infrastructure changes, including migrations from legacy systems to AWS cloud infrastructure and lift-and-shift migrations</li><li>Designing and implementing monitoring plans and building automations for monitoring, software deployments, and operational workflows</li><li>Performing system monitoring, system backups, incident response, database migrations, database configurations, and cost optimization<br><br><br><br></li></ul><b>What You Won’t Be Doing<br><br><br><br></b><ul><li>Living in Jira and endless status meetings - we value people who can drive solutions, not just track problems</li><li>Maintaining outdated systems indefinitely - you&#39;ll be empowered to drive meaningful improvements</li><li>Getting blocked by bureaucratic approval chains - you&#39;ll have the authority to execute immediate fixes to resolve incidents</li><li>Getting stuck in narrow technical silos - this role requires both breadth and depth of expertise</li><li>Fighting for budget to implement critical improvements - we understand the importance of infrastructure investment<br><br><br><br></li></ul><b>Senior DevOps Engineer Key Responsibilities<br><br><br><br></b>Drive reliability and standardization of cloud infrastructure across our growing product portfolio by implementing robust monitoring, automation, and AWS best practices.<br><br><br><br><b>Basic Requirements<br><br><br><br></b><ul><li>Deep AWS infrastructure expertise (this is our primary platform - other cloud experience alone won&#39;t cut it)</li><li>Strong programming skills in Python or JavaScript for building automation and tooling</li><li>Experience managing and migrating production databases with multiple engines (including MySql, Postgres, Oracle, MS-SQL)</li><li>Advanced Docker/Kubernetes skills</li><li>Experience with infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation)</li><li>Linux systems administration expertise<br><br><br><br></li></ul><b>About Trilogy<br><br><br><br></b>Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.
