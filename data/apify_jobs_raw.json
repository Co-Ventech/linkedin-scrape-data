That DNA remains at our core, but today we are evolving into a fully remote, globally distributed Investment Management business. This transformation reflects a broader ambition: to scale our edge, deliver institutional-grade results, and set new standards for the industry.\nOur quantitative environment is built to empower innovation, combining vast data capabilities, disciplined model development, and highly automated execution.

Our technology empowers builders to launch sovereign blockchains and decentralized applications (dApps) that are secure, scalable, and interoperable.\n\nAiB is a longstanding contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem. In 2014, our CEO, Jae Kwon, was the first to introduce a solution to the Proof-of-Stake distributed consensus problem, building the core infrastructure that powers Cosmos today, including Tendermint Core and Cosmos SDK. AiB also conceptualized and contributed to the development of Cosmos' standard for blockchain interoperability, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).  \n\nWe’re currently supporting the development of three new projects, Gno.land, Tendermint2, and Decentralists DAO, as well as the continued development of Ignite. From creating and funding to engineering and marketing, we prioritize simplistic and minimalistic approaches to building technological solutions that endure.\n\nAiB is committed to upholding core Cosmos values of transparency, accountability, and decentralization. We aim to advance core components of the Cosmos tech stack and encourage open dialogue, informed decision-making, and bleeding-edge innovation.",

That DNA remains at our core, but today we are evolving into a fully remote, globally distributed Investment Management business. This transformation reflects a broader ambition: to scale our edge, deliver institutional-grade results, and set new standards for the industry.\nOur quantitative environment is built to empower innovation, combining vast data capabilities, disciplined model development, and highly automated execution.

But whether we’re looking to save for a rainy day, grow our money, buy a home, or even build a retirement fund, we leave it at the bottom of our to-do lists because we're not sure how to get started.\n\nThis isn’t surprising. We aren’t taught about financial planning at school, the wealth industry was built to serve a minority, and it often feels like banks don’t care about helping us achieve outcomes. To top it off, the financial services industry is fragmented and confusing.\n\nThis means that our money often isn’t working hard enough and our goals are much harder to achieve.\n\nSo, we made a solution.\n\nWe've brought saving, investing, home-buying, and retirement services together into one simple app. So people can reach their goals and build wealth with confidence, whatever their starting point.\n\nWe want to help people build wealth, but our mission goes beyond that. We believe that building wealth isn’t simply about accumulating more money. It’s about going after the life you want and enjoying it to the fullest, today and tomorrow. This is what it means to turn your money into something greater.",
