Here’s what you should tell your frontend developer about the changes:
---
## **Backend API Changes for LinkedIn Job Comments & Status**
### 1. **Status Tracking**
- **Status is now tracked with user info.**
- Each status change (e.g., "engaged", "not_engaged") is recorded with:
  - The new status
  - The username of the person who made the change
  - The date/time of the change
- The current status is available as `currentStatus`.
- The full history is available as `statusHistory` (array).
### 2. **Comments**
- Comments are now stored as objects with:
  - `username` (who made the comment)
  - `comment` (the text)
  - `date` (when it was made)
- The comments array is available as `comments`.
### 3. **AE Comment for AI Remark Validation**
- There is a new field called `ae_comment` for the AE (Account Executive) to give feedback on whether the AI remark is correct or not.
---
## **How to Use the API**
### **PATCH `/api/jobs/:jobId`**
- To update status, comment, or AE comment, send a PATCH request with any of these fields:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "engaged",           // optional, one of the allowed statuses
    "username": "selectedUser",    // required when updating status or comment
    "comment": "My comment here",  // optional
    "ae_comment": "AI remark is correct" // optional
  }
  ```
- You can send any combination of these fields.
  - If you update status, include `username`.
  - If you add a comment, include `username` and `comment`.
  - If you want to give AE feedback, include `ae_comment`.
### **Response**
- The backend will update the job’s `currentStatus`, append to `statusHistory`, add to `comments`, and/or update `ae_comment` as appropriate.
---
## **Frontend UI Suggestions**
- At the top of the UI, provide a user selection dropdown (for username).
- When a user clicks "Engaged" or changes status, send the selected username and new status.
- When adding a comment, send the selected username and comment text.
- Provide a field for AE to enter feedback on the AI remark, and send it as `ae_comment`.
